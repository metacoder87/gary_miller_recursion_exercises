# Warmup

# Write a recursive method, range, that takes a start and an end and returns an 
# array of all numbers in that range, exclusive. For example, range(1, 5) should 
# return [1, 2, 3, 4]. If end < start, you can return an empty array.


    def range(first, past_last)
        first >= past_last ? [] : [first] + range(first + 1, past_last)
    end

    # test
puts "Range \n"
p range(1, 4) # => [1, 2, 3] 
p range(3, 10) # => [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
p range(9, 14) # => [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
p range(10, 8) # => []

# Write both a recursive and iterative version of sum of an array.

    def iter_sum(array)
        array.inject(:+)
    end

    def recur_sum(array)
        array.count > 1 ? array.first + recur_sum(array.drop(1)) : array.first
    end

    # test
puts "Sum iteration \n"
p iter_sum([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) # => 15
p iter_sum([5, 10, -4]) # => 11
p iter_sum([1, 2, 3, 126, -7]) # => 125
p iter_sum([18, 6, 42, 0]) # => 66

puts "Sum recursion \n"
p recur_sum([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) # => 15
p recur_sum([5, 10, -4]) # => 11
p recur_sum([1, 2, 3, 126, -7]) # => 125
p recur_sum([18, 6, 42, 0]) # => 66

# Exponentiation

# Write two versions of exponent that use two different recursions:

# # this is math, not Ruby methods.

# # recursion 1
# exp(b, 0) = 1
# exp(b, n) = b * exp(b, n - 1)

    def expo(base, power)
        power > 1 ? base * expo(base, power - 1) : base == 2 && power == 0 ? 1 : base
    end

    # test
puts "Exponent 1 \n"
p expo(2, 3) # => 8
p expo(3, 2) # => 9
p expo(3, 3) # => 27
p expo(9, 1) # => 9
p expo(1, 0) # => 1
p expo(0, 1) # => 0
p expo(1, 1) # => 1
p expo(1, 2) # => 1
p expo(2, 0) # => 1
p expo(2, 1) # => 2
p expo(2, 2) # => 4
p expo(3, 5) # => 243


# # recursion 2
# exp(b, 0) = 1
# exp(b, 1) = b
# exp(b, n) = exp(b, n / 2) ** 2             [for even n]
# exp(b, n) = b * (exp(b, (n - 1) / 2) ** 2) [for odd n]
# Note that for recursion 2, you will need to square the results of exp(b, n / 2) 
# and (exp(b, (n - 1) / 2). Remember that you don't need to do anything special 
# to square a number, just calculate the value and multiply it by itself. 
# So don't cheat and use exponentiation in your solution.

# Suggestion: Break the methods down into parts..
# https://open.appacademy.io/learn/full-stack-online/ruby/breaking-methods-into-parts

# Suggestion 2: Try walking through your code with Simple Examples.

# If the n == 256, 
# about how many nested recursive steps will we run in the first case?

# How deep will we need to recurse for the second? 
# Keep in mind that the first reduces the exponent by one for each recursion, 
# while the second reduces it by half.

# In addition to testing your methods by running the code, 
# try the following exercise:

# On paper, write out the value of each variable for every line in the code:

# Write out what happens with base 0 and power 0 as inputs (should be easy). 
# e.g., if you had run exp(0,0).
# Write out what happens for base 0 and power 1. e.g., if you had run exp(0,1).
# Write out what happens for base 1 and power 0.
# Write out what happens for base 1 and power 1.
# Write out what happens for base 1 and power 2.
# Write out what happens for base 2 and power 0.
# Write out what happens for base 2 and power 1.
# Write out what happens for base 2 and power 2.
# Make sure you can trace from the very beginning to the very end in these examples.

# How many examples do you need to walk through to be confident that it works?

    def exponent(base, power)
        power > 1 && power % 2 == 0 ? exponent(base, power / 2) * exponent(base,power / 2) : power > 1 && power % 2 != 0 ? base * (exponent(base, (power - 1) / 2) * exponent(base, (power -1) / 2)) : base == 2 && power == 0 ? 1 : base
    end

    # test
puts "Exponent 2 \n"
p exponent(2, 3) # => 8
p exponent(3, 2) # => 9
p exponent(3, 3) # => 27*
p exponent(9, 1) # => 9
p exponent(1, 0) # => 1
p exponent(0, 1) # => 0
p exponent(1, 1) # => 1
p exponent(1, 2) # => 1
p exponent(2, 0) # => 1*
p exponent(2, 1) # => 2
p exponent(2, 2) # => 4
p exponent(3, 5) # => 243

# Deep dup

# The #dup method doesn't make a deep copy:

# robot_parts = [
#   ["nuts", "bolts", "washers"],
#   ["capacitors", "resistors", "inductors"]
# ]

# robot_parts_copy = robot_parts.dup

# # shouldn't modify robot_parts
# robot_parts_copy[1] << "LEDs"
# # but it does
# robot_parts[1] # => ["capacitors", "resistors", "inductors", "LEDs"]
# When we dup an Array, it creates a new array to hold the elements, but doesn't 
# recursively dup any arrays contained therein. So the dup method creates one new 
# array, but just copies over references to the original interior arrays.

# Sometimes you want a shallow dup and sometimes you want a deep dup. Ruby keeps 
# things simple by giving you shallow dup, and letting you write deep dup yourself.

# Using recursion and the is_a? method, write an Array#deep_dup method that will 
# perform a "deep" duplication of the interior arrays.

# Note: For simplicity's sake, we are only going to ensure the deep duplication 
# of arrays. Don't worry about deep-duping (or regular-duping) other types of 
# mutable objects (like strings, hashes, instances of custom classes, etc.), 
# since this would require that we implement a deep dup method for each of 
# those classes, as well.

# It's okay to iterate over array elements using the normal each for this one :-)

# You should be able to handle "mixed" arrays. For instance: [1, [2], [3, [4]]].

    def deep_dup(array)
        array.count > 1 ? deep_dup(array.drop(1)).unshift(array.first.dup) : array.dup
    end

    # test
p deep_dup([1, [2], [3, [4]]])
p deep_dup([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7], 8])
p deep_dup([])
p deep_dup([1])

# Fibonacci

# Write a recursive and an iterative Fibonacci method. The method should take in 
# an integer n and return the first n Fibonacci numbers in an array.

# You shouldn't have to pass any arrays between methods; you should be able to do 
# this just passing a single argument for the number of Fibonacci numbers requested.

# Binary Search

# The binary search algorithm begins by comparing the target value to the value 
# of the middle element of the sorted array. If the target value is equal to the 
# middle element's value, then the position is returned and the search is 
# finished. If the target value is less than the middle element's value, then the 
# search continues on the lower half of the array; or if the target value is 
# greater than the middle element's value, then the search continues on the upper 
# half of the array. This process continues, eliminating half of the elements, 
# and comparing the target value to the value of the middle element of the 
# remaining elements - until the target value is either found (and its associated 
#     element position is returned), or until the entire array has been searched 
#     (and "not found" is returned).

# Write a recursive binary search: bsearch(array, target). 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm
# Note that binary search only works on sorted arrays. Make sure to return the 
# location of the found object (or nil if not found!). 
# Hint: you will probably want to use subarrays.

# Make sure that these test cases are working:

# bsearch([1, 2, 3], 1) # => 0
# bsearch([2, 3, 4, 5], 3) # => 1
# bsearch([2, 4, 6, 8, 10], 6) # => 2
# bsearch([1, 3, 4, 5, 9], 5) # => 3
# bsearch([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 6) # => 5
# bsearch([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 0) # => nil
# bsearch([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7], 6) # => nil

# Merge Sort

# Implement a method merge_sort that sorts an Array:

# The base cases are for arrays of length zero or one. 
# Do not use a length-two array as a base case. This is unnecessary.
# You'll want to write a merge helper method to merge the sorted halves.
# To get a visual idea of how merge sort works, 
# watch this gif
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort#/media/File:Merge-sort-example-300px.gif
# and check out this diagram.

# Array Subsets

# Write a method subsets that will return all subsets of an array.

# subsets([]) # => [[]]
# subsets([1]) # => [[], [1]]
# subsets([1, 2]) # => [[], [1], [2], [1, 2]]
# subsets([1, 2, 3])
# # => [[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]

# You can implement this as an Array method if you prefer.

# Hint: For subsets([1, 2, 3]), there are two kinds of subsets:

# Those that do not contain 3 (all of these are subsets of [1, 2]).
# For every subset that does not contain 3, there is also a corresponding subset 
# that is the same, except it also does contain 3.

# Permutations

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation
# Write a recursive method permutations(array) that calculates all the 
# permutations of the given array. For an array of length n there are n! 
# different permutations. So for an array with three elements we will have 
# 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 different permutations.

# permutations([1, 2, 3]) # => [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2],
#                         #     [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1],
#                         #     [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
# You can use Ruby's built in Array#permutation method to get a better 
# understanding of what you will be building.

# [1, 2, 3].permutation.to_a  # => [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2],
#                             #     [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1],
#                             #     [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]

# Make Change

# RubyQuiz: Make change.
# https://web.archive.org/web/20130215052843/http://rubyquiz.com/quiz154.html 

# Here's a game plan for solving the problem:

# First, write a 'greedy' version called greedy_make_change:

# Take as many of the biggest coin as possible and add them to your result.
# Add to the result by recursively calling your method on the remaining amount, 
# leaving out the biggest coin, until the remainder is zero.
# Once you have a working greedy version, talk with your partner about refactoring 
# this to make_better_change. What's wrong with greedy_make_change?

# Consider the case of greedy_make_change(24, [10,7,1]). Because it takes as many 
#     10 pieces as possible, 
#     greedy_make_change misses the correct answer of [10,7,7] (try it in pry).

# To make_better_change, we only take one coin at a time and never rule out 
# denominations that we've already used. This allows each coin to be available 
# each time we get a new remainder. By iterating over the denominations and 
# continuing to search for the best change, we assure that we test for 
# 'non-greedy' uses of each denomination.

# Discuss the following game plan 
# and then work together to implement your new method:

# Iterate over each coin.
# Grab only one of that one coin and recursively call make_better_change on the 
# remainder using coins less than or equal to the current coin.
# Add the single coin to the change returned by the recursive call. 
# This will be a possible solution, but maybe not the best one.
# Keep track of the best solution and return it at the end.
# N.B. Don't generate every possible permutation of coins and then compare them. 
# Remember that a permutation is not the same thing as a combination - 
# we will need to check every combination of coins that add up to our target, 
# we just don't want to check the same combination in different orders. 
# If you get stuck you can start by writing a solution that calculates and 
# compares all of the permutations without storing them in an array. Then go back 
# and refactor your solution so that it only calculates and compares all of the
# different combinations. If you and your partner get totally stuck, or would 
# like to compare your answer, feel free to reference this 
# https://vimeo.com/91207646

# Make sure you and your partner understand each line before moving on.
